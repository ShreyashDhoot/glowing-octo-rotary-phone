"""
Bayesian Hyperparameter Search for Swiss-Knife ``elo_swiss_mode_b`` GSI Strategy
==================================================================================
Multi-GPU parallel search (judge-per-GPU). Designed for a pool of independent
GPUs (e.g. 8x A6000 48GB) where each GPU is assigned its own config from the
round's queue and runs that config's FULL cycle (generation, then its own
private judge server, then scoring) to completion before picking up the next
config. Generation and judging still never overlap in VRAM WITHIN a single
GPU's worker (same OOM-safety rule as before), but different GPUs run their
own generate->judge->score cycles fully concurrently with each other.

This preserves the original single-GPU sequential codepath as the special
case of a worker pool of size 1 (pass a single --gpu-ids value to keep the
old behavior); the underlying per-config logic (subprocess commands, judge
server lifecycle, scalar_objective, checkpointing) is unchanged.

HYPERPARAMETERS BEING SEARCHED  (6-dimensional search space)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  elo_temperature  [1.0,  40.0]  Temperature T in the UWO logit: (R_i-1500)/T.
                                 Higher T → flatter probability distribution
                                 over candidates (more exploration).
  w_tournament     [0.0,  3.0]   Weight for the Elo rating term in Step C UWO
                                 logit. Controls how much the Swiss tournament
                                 result influences final champion selection.
  w_blade          [0.0,  3.0]   Weight for the blade UWO term (μ - λσ) in
                                 Step C. Controls how much the DPO blade reward
                                 and its uncertainty influence selection.
  uwo_lambda       [0.0,  1.0]   Uncertainty penalty λ. Penalises candidates
                                 with high σ (risk-averse selection).
  elo_rounds       [2,    10]    Number of Elo rating update rounds inside the
                                 Swiss tournament bracket.
  gsi_n            [3,    16]    Number of candidate steps sampled from the
                                 Drafter per decoding step.

  NOTE — beta (DPO regularization strength) is FIXED at 0.1 and NOT searched.
  Rationale: (1) β should match the value used during blade training for
  principled KL-penalty calibration. (2) The blade reward is Z-normalized
  before entering the UWO logit, so any multiplicative constant (including β)
  cancels out — its effect is entirely subsumed by w_blade. Sweeping β would
  add a redundant 7th dimension without any discriminative power.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ALGORITHMIC NOTES  (what this script DOES to the GP, not what elo_system.py
                    does to candidate steps)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Step C UWO logit (inside elo_system.py, called per decoding step):
    logit_i = w_tournament * znorm((R_i-1500)/T)  +  w_blade * znorm(μ_i - λ·σ_i)
  Each COMPLETE term is Z-normalized independently across the N candidates
  (zero mean, unit std) BEFORE being scaled by its weight.  This ensures
  w_tournament and w_blade have genuinely comparable effects regardless of T.
  See WHY below.

Z-Normalization (ONLY applied here, to the GP surrogate's TARGET values):
  This script Z-normalises the collected *scalar objective* observations
  before feeding them into the Gaussian Process surrogate model:
      yn = (y - mean(y)) / std(y)
  Why? GP kernels implicitly assume the target function has unit variance.
  Without Z-normalisation the squared-exponential kernel's hyperparameters
  (especially the output scale) are poorly conditioned when the objective
  values span a very different range from the kernel's prior.  Z-normalisation
  re-centres and re-scales the targets to mean 0, std 1 — making the GP's
  default kernel priors well-matched and its Expected Improvement estimates
  numerically stable.  The EI threshold (0.01) is then expressed in the same
  standardised units as the GP's output.
  Note: this normalisation is ONLY applied to the y_obs fed to the GP; the
  raw objective values stored in search_state.json and all_observations.csv
  are always the original (un-normalised) tribunal scores.

  FIX: `estimate_expected_improvement` (used for the round-end convergence
  check against --min-expected-improvement) now computes EI entirely in
  this normalised space -- mu, sigma, and best-so-far are all kept in
  Z-scored units and never converted back to raw objective units before
  the EI formula is applied. Previously the mean/std were denormalised
  back to raw units first, which made EI scale with the raw objective's
  standard deviation and could trigger a false "converged" stop when raw
  scores were tightly clustered (e.g. early rounds), independent of
  whether the GP had actually run out of promising, uncertain regions to
  explore.

GP length-scale fitting (ARD, marginal-likelihood optimized):
  skopt's ``Optimizer(..., base_estimator="GP")`` path constructs a
  scikit-learn GaussianProcessRegressor under the hood. Left at its library
  default this already uses a Matern kernel with an independent length-scale
  PER DIMENSION (automatic relevance determination, "ARD") and fits those
  length-scales (plus the output/noise scale) by maximizing the GP marginal
  log-likelihood via L-BFGS restarts -- it does NOT use a single fixed
  length-scale. To make this explicit and to pin it down regardless of skopt
  version/defaults drifting, `propose_next_batch_skopt` below now builds the
  `GaussianProcessRegressor` itself with an explicit per-dimension
  `length_scale` array, `length_scale_bounds` that allow the optimizer to
  move (not clamp) the scales, `normalize_y=True`, and several
  `n_restarts_optimizer` restarts, and passes it in as `base_estimator`.

  The `propose_next_batch_builtin` fallback (only used when `skopt` is not
  installed) previously used a single hardcoded `length_scale = 0.3` shared
  across all 6 hyperparameter dimensions -- this is the actual bug described
  above. It now fits one length-scale PER DIMENSION by numerically
  maximizing the GP marginal log-likelihood (`_fit_ard_length_scales`),
  falling back to a shared default only when there are too few observations
  to fit 6 independent scales reliably (n < d + 2).

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
EXECUTION FLOW
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1.  Startup: load runs/bayes_search/search_state.json if it exists
    (crash-safe resume); otherwise build Round 0 = 1 fixed default config +
    (round0_size - 1) Sobol space-filling configs. round0_size defaults to
    ~10x the search dimensionality (10 * 6 = 60; see --initial-round-size)
    rather than --configs-per-round, so the very first round densely covers
    the 6-D space before the GP starts trusting local structure. These
    configs are still dispatched through the normal --gpu-ids worker pool,
    so with e.g. 8 GPUs a 60-config round 0 naturally runs as ~8 sequential
    waves per GPU (each GPU pulls its next config off the shared queue the
    instant it frees up -- no explicit "wave" bookkeeping needed).

2.  Per-round evaluation via a GPU worker pool (--gpu-ids, default all 8):
      Every config in the round's queue is handed to the next free GPU worker.
      Each worker owns ONE physical GPU for the config's ENTIRE cycle below,
      so N configs (N = number of GPUs) run fully in parallel, each isolated
      to its own CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES:
      a. Launch benchmark_gsi_strategies_harmlessness.py as a subprocess
         with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<gpu_id>.  Block until complete.
      b. Sleep 5 s to let VRAM drain.
      c. Launch this worker's OWN vLLM judge server (Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,
         bitsandbytes 4-bit) on the SAME gpu_id.  Poll /v1/models until ready
         (up to 15 min). Each GPU worker gets its own judge server and port
         (8000 + gpu_id), fully independent of every other GPU's judge.
      d. Run tribunal.run_eval against this worker's judge server.
      e. Kill the judge server.  Sleep 5 s.
      f. Read model_summary.csv, compute the scalar objective:
           quality = mean(response_quality, relevance)
           safety  = 1 - mean(toxicity, harmfulness)
           objective = (2 * quality * safety) / (quality + safety)
      g. Append the record and IMMEDIATELY write both search_state.json
         (full state, resumable) and all_observations.csv (for inspection).
         Writes are serialized across workers with a lock so concurrent GPU
         workers finishing at the same time never corrupt the checkpoint.
         Optionally push to Hugging Face Hub as an offsite backup.
      h. On generation or scoring failure for a given GPU's config: log the
         error, return the config to the round's queue for a retry by any
         free worker, and keep that GPU's worker alive for the next config.
         A config is only abandoned (search aborts) on repeated Ctrl-C.

3.  End of each round:
      a. Fit a GP surrogate on all observations so far (both skopt and the
         built-in path Z-normalise y_obs before fitting, and both now fit
         per-dimension (ARD) length-scales to the data rather than using a
         single fixed length-scale -- see "GP length-scale fitting" above).
      b. Propose the next batch of configs via Expected Improvement (EI)
         with a diversity penalty so the proposals spread across the space.
      c. If max(EI) < min_expected_improvement (default 0.01) AND at least
         --min-rounds rounds have been completed, STOP. The --min-rounds
         floor (default 4) exists specifically so a round can't declare
         "converged" purely because the batch just evaluated happened to be
         sparse/uninformative early on -- the search must run a minimum
         number of full rounds regardless of the EI value before an
         EI-based stop is honored.
      d. Save checkpoint for the new round's configs.
      e. Generate intermediate plots (hp_effects, pareto frontier,
         convergence, correlation heatmap, GP partial dependence).
      f. Thermal cooldown: sleep for cooldown_seconds (default 3600 = 1 h)
         while printing a live countdown; user can press Enter to skip.

4.  On search completion (EI threshold met AND min-rounds satisfied, or
    Ctrl-C):
      Fit a final surrogate, generate final plots, and write best_config.json.

OOM SAFETY
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Generation (Drafter 3B + Blade 7B+LoRA + Base Verifier 7B) ≈ 34 GB VRAM.
  Judge (Qwen2.5-32B 4-bit) ≈ 20–24 GB VRAM.
  Combined ≈ 54–58 GB — too large for concurrent execution on a single 48 GB
  A6000 when accounting for CUDA overhead and activations. This rule is
  enforced PER GPU WORKER: within one GPU's worker thread, the generation
  subprocess fully exits and VRAM is released (sleep) BEFORE that worker's
  own judge server starts on the same GPU, and vice versa. This is entirely
  independent per GPU, so GPU 0 judging and GPU 1 generating at the same
  moment is fine — they are different physical devices with separate VRAM.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
KEY CLI FLAGS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  --repo-root              Repo root (contains evaluation/, tribunal/, etc.)
  --configs-per-round      Configs per round from round 1 onward (default 16).
                            Round 0 uses --initial-round-size instead (see
                            below) so the very first round is much denser.
  --initial-round-size     Number of configs in ROUND 0 specifically (default:
                            10x the search dimensionality, i.e. 10*6 = 60,
                            clamped to [50, 70] per the usual 6-D rule of
                            thumb). These are still spread across whatever
                            GPU worker pool --gpu-ids defines; with 8 GPUs
                            that's roughly 8 sequential waves per GPU.
  --min-rounds             Minimum number of FULL rounds that must complete
                            before an EI-based convergence stop is allowed,
                            regardless of how low max(EI) is (default 4).
                            Prevents a false early stop from a sparse/lucky
                            early round.
  --gpu-ids                Comma-separated physical GPU indices forming the
                            worker pool, e.g. "0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7" (default: all
                            8 GPUs 0-7). Each listed GPU runs its own
                            generate->judge->score cycle concurrently with
                            the others. Pass a single id (e.g. "0") to fall
                            back to the original single-GPU sequential run.
  --num-prompts            Prompts per config evaluation (default 15)
  --max-tokens              Max generation tokens (default 512)
  --judge-model             vLLM judge model (default Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct)
  --min-expected-improvement  EI stopping threshold (default 0.01)
  --cooldown-seconds        Thermal break between rounds in seconds (default 3600)
  --manual-resume            Pause before each config and wait for Enter
  --hf-repo-id                Optional HF Hub dataset repo for offsite backups
  --output-root              Root for all output dirs (default: repo-root)

    """Evaluate every config in ``configs`` using a pool of GPU workers.

    Each GPU in ``gpu_ids`` runs its own persistent worker loop: pull the next
    config off a single shared queue, run its full generate->judge->score
    cycle, then IMMEDIATELY pull the next one -- independent of how long any
    other GPU's current config takes. A GPU never waits for the rest of the
    round to catch up before picking up new work; it only goes idle once the
    shared queue is empty and every in-flight config has finished.

    With a densely-populated round (e.g. a 50-70 config round 0) and a fixed
    GPU pool, this loop structure IS the "multiple waves" execution: each GPU
    just keeps dequeuing until the shared queue is empty, so a round with
    e.g. 70 configs across 8 GPUs naturally plays out as ~9 sequential
    per-GPU waves without any extra wave-scheduling logic being required.

    A config that fails with a genuine CUDA/GPU out-of-memory error is
    DROPPED PERMANENTLY here -- it is never re-queued, and it never enters
    ``shared['evaluated_configs']``, so it is excluded entirely from the GP
    fit (as if that config had never been proposed). The GPU that hit the
    OOM immediately moves on to the next pending config; nothing else about
    the pool or the other GPU workers is affected. Any other kind of
    failure (RETRY) is re-queued for the next free GPU, exactly as before.

    This does not change the search math (GP/EI/Z-normalization) at all --
    it only parallelizes the per-config subprocess work of a round across
    independent physical GPUs. With ``gpu_ids == [g]`` (a single GPU) this
    reduces exactly to the original strictly-sequential behavior.
